		"content": "On the second season of Breaking Bad, Walter White infamously throws a pizza onto the roof of his home. In an interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Cranston said the production team had actually set aside hours to get the testing, which he ended up completing in one take. When fans saw an unsliced pizza swirl into the air to land perfectly on the roof they were a little confused, wondering what pizza place sells unsliced pizza. But, in a 2017 Reddit AMA, Vince Gilligan explained that he and the production team knew eagle-eyed fans would catch this, so they added a scene to explain the situation. You might remember the scene, which takes place in Jesse's apartment. Badger and Skinny Pete show up with a pile of unsliced pizzas and Badger tells Jesse they're unsliced because that's the gimmick â€¦ they don't cut the pizza, and they pass the savings on to you."
